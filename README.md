# Data-Extraction-of-table-tag-from-xml
Here is the code i have written to extract table tags information from xml file

There are three files in the XMLParsing folder namely "level2.xml","element.py" and "output.txt" .
"level2.xml" contain a tables tag and inside the <table> tag it contain entry tag.

I have written a python script that extract the id from the tables tag and give information that are stored in each 
entry tag.

Requirements:
- This code is writen on python3 make sure you have python version 3 installed.
- If you want to run it on python version 2 then just remove round brackets(parenthesis) after print statement.
- You can use a editor IDE to run the code or you could simply run it using cmd terminal.
