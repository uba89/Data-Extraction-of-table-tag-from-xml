The state-of-the-art antimicrobial finishes based on nano silver are yellow to dark brown in colour depending upon the silver concentration. When these silver nanodispersions are applied to textile or polymeric substrates, it often results in poor aesthetics in terms of lower Whiteness Index or higher Yellowness Index, which is undesirable primarily for white and pale shade garments or substrates.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The problem of colour is further aggravated as nanosilver dispersions are required to be applied on textiles/substrate at high concentration for effective antimicrobial activity (&gt;80%). The Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) values for dispersions of silver nanoparticles are in the range of 5-1000 ppm (references given in text below), which is quite high. The silver is a precious metal and its application at higher concentration is commercially undesirable.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, the dispersions of nanosilver based finishes available in prior art are non durable. The nanoparticles tend to agglomerate and settle down with time in the dispersion form giving poor shelf life. Several additives used for stabilizing these nanofinishes often impart still deeper colours to the nano dispersion making it undesirable. When applied on substrates they lose their efficacy on repeated washing as the silver nano particles or their agglomerate tends to wash off the substrate. If binders are used, the nanosilver loses its high degree of activity against the bacteria.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The synthesis techniques of silver nanoparticles are categorized into bottom-up and top-down approaches. Some of the important approaches are listed below:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Bottom-up approach can be used with the following methods:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Chemical reduction method. This involves the dissolution of silver salt into a solvent (aqueous or non-aqueous) and subsequent addition of a suitable reducing agent e.g. chemical reduction of silver ion in aqueous solutions or non-aqueous solutions (Maribel G. Guzmán, Jean Dille, Stephan Godet, World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology 43 2008; Zaheer Khan, Shaeel Ahmed Al-Thabaiti, Abdullah Yousif Obaid, A. O.

Dubinsky, S. Gazit, A. Gedanken, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 104, 1423-1430 (2007)). The chemical effects of ultrasound arise from acoustic cavitation, that is, the formation, growth, and when solutions are exposed to strong ultrasound irradiation, bubbles in the solution are implosively collapsed by acoustic fields. Cavitation bubble collapse can also induce a shock wave in the solution and drive rapid impact of the liquid to the surface of the particles.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Photoinduced or photocatalytic reduction (C. C. Chang, C. K. Lin, C. C. Chan, C. S. Hsu, C. Y. Chen, Thin Solid Films 494 (2006) 274-278; Lizhi Zhang, Jimmy C.

It takes very long time (sometimes over 70 hours, R Jin, Y Wei Cao and C A. Mirkin, SCIENCE 294 (2001)).

Coalescence of the nanoparticles may lose their characteristic properties. Thus, stability of the nanoparticles in dispersion is a matter of concern for long time use and to achieve the same efficacy. Antonio M. Brito-Silva et. al., Journal of Nanomaterials, 2010, Article ID 142897, reported synthesis of silver nanoparticles by laser ablation in preformed colloids in non-aqueous media of methanol, acetone, ethylene glycol etc. The stability could be achieved from 8 days till a maximum of around 5 months with different protective agents in non-aqueus media. Some have tried to see the effect of different protective agents on aggregation behaviour of silver nanoparticles and its antimicrobial activity (L Kvitek, A Panacek and J Soukupova, J. Phys. Chem. C 112 5825 (2008); J Soukupova, L Kvitek et al., J Materials Chemistry and Physics 111 77 (2008)). It was observed that addition of ionic protective agents improved the zeta potential (stability) of the nanoparticle dispersion than without protective agents.

Another prior art reported an average particle size of 18 nm of spherical nanosilver and MBC values in the range from 10 to 0.15 pg/ml (ppm) against various bacteria that are pathogenic to lower animals such as fish. However, the MBC values were evaluated after 30-90 minutes of incubation time, which is a very short time to see the actual growth of pathogen and is not a standard procedure to evaluate MBC.

The result of such a high concentration application eventually gives the fabric yellow to brown tinge depending on concentration. Durability of the silver nanoparticle finish is also a concern. Silver nanoparticles tend to wash off during repeated washing. And if the Ag nanoparticles are used with binders, though wash durability improves to some extent, the maximum efficiency/antimicrobial activity of nanoparticles gets reduced due to hindrance of binder.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In order to overcome the yellowing nature of dispersion of nanosilver, when applied as finish on textile fabrics, nanosilver dispersion of colours other than yellow and brown such as blue or purple can be prepared using the knowledge available in prior art. This can be done either in a solvent (non aqueous) or water (aqueous) system.

Also the particle size of silver nanoparticles was large in the range of 20 nm to 50 nm. Though antimicrobial activity of these colloids were not reported, based on other studies as reported above, it is likely that these colloids would be needed to be applied in large concentrations for effective antimicrobial activity due to their large particles size.

Particles, emulsions and macromolecules in suspension undergo Brownian motion. This is the motion induced by the bombardment by solvent molecules that themselves are moving due to their thermal energy. If the particles or molecules are illuminated with a laser, the intensity of the scattered light fluctuates at a rate that is dependent upon the size of the particles. Analysis of these intensity fluctuations yields the velocity of the Brownian motion and hence the particle size using the Stokes-Einstein relationship (Malvern Instruments, technical note). The fundamental size distribution generated by DLS is an intensity distribution, and then, it is converted, using Mie theory (Malvern Instruments, technical note; Chem.

A major peak appeares at 687 nm, &amp; a very small peak at around 335 nm. Molar extinction coefficient of blue coloured nanosilver dispersion without surfactant is 10.9 (mM-cm)<sup>−1 </sup>at the maximum wavelength of absorption of 687 nm. No plasmonic peak is observed in the range 390-410 nm indicating absence of spherical silver nanoparticles. Also, there is no plasmonic peak between 410-500 nm indicating a substantially different shape and/or size than those reported for prisms of prior art. The mathematical modeling of the nanopartices has shown that occurrence of plasmonic peaks is highly associated with the shape and size of the nanoparticles (ref. Advanced Materials, 17, No. 4, February 23, (2005), By Gabriella S. Métraux and Chad A. Mirkin). The aqueous dispersions of silver nanoprisms of prior art show at least three and sometime four plasmonic bands in the range 300-350 nm, 390-410 nm, 410-500 nm and 650-700 nm.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The UV-Vis measurement of blue coloured aqueous dispersion of silver nanoparticles after 15 months of storage is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>). The graph gives a characteristic UV-vis spectrum which clearly reflects that their anisotropic shape is preserved with time. The absence of peak in the range of 390-410 nm indicates that anisotropic particles are stable with time and have not degenerated to spherical particles. Also, the absence of peak in plasmonic band of 410-500 nm indicates that uniqueness of the silver nanoparticles is preserved with time. There is only a slight shift of maximum absorption wavelength to 714 nm is seen. The shift is likely due to the deagglomeration of bigger size particles, which is also supported by particle size analysis by DLS (see below).

The optical absorption has remained same, while a slight shift was seen in maximum wavelength value with storage time (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). This implies that concentration, shape and size of Ag nanoparticles in aqueous dispersion has not changed with time. The shift is likely due to the deagglomeration of the bigger size particles to smaller agglomerates as also seen by particle size measurement.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">There is also no settlement of nanosilver particles or change in colour or appearance with time.

Because of de-agglomeration to smaller size, the samples show higher antimicrobial activity with MBC value of less than 0.09, more precisely, in the range 0.055 to 0.01 ppm.
